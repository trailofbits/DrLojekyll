; This is to show that we want prove `indirect(1)` iff we get a `something` message. The interesting
; thing is that none of the variables related to `something` are used to prove `indirect(1)`.

#message something(i32 X)
#query proof(free i32 X)
#local indirect(i32 X)

has_something : something(_).
indirect(1) : has_something.
proof(A) : indirect(A).
