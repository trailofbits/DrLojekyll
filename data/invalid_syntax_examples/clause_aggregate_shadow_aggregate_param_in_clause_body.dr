; The use of an aggregating functor can be paired with a predicate or an
; inline-defined predicate. A variable that flows into an aggregate parameter
; should not be shadowed / used in the rest of the clause body. Here, the
; variable `X` in `input(X)` is logically unrelated to the `X` in `sum(X, Y)`.

#functor sum(aggregate i32 X, summary i32 Y)

#message input(i32 X)
#message output(i32 X)

output(Y) : sum(X, Y) over (i32 X) { input(X) }, input(X).
