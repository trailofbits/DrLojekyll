; The use of an aggregating functor can be paired with a predicate or an
; inline-defined predicate. The variable over which the aggregating functor
; is aggregating must be supplied as an output of whatever is inside of the
; `over ...` part of the predicate. 

#functor sum(aggregate i32 X, summary i32 Y)

#message input(i32 X)
#message output(i32 X)
output(Y) : sum(X, Y) over (i32 Z) {input(Z)}.
