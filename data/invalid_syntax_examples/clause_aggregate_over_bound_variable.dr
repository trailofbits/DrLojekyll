; The use of an aggregating functor can be paired with a predicate or an
; inline-defined predicate. The variable over which the aggregating functor
; is aggregating must be interpreted as being a stream of values. Thus, we
; should not be passing in a `bound`-attributed parameter of any kind.

#functor sum(aggregate i32 X, summary i32 Y)
#query input(bound i32 X)

#message output(i32 X)
output(Y) : sum(X, Y) over input(X).
